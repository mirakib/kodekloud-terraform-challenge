# Delete IAM Role Using Terraform

Delete the IAM role named `iamrole_kareem` using Terraform. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.


The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different `.tf` file) to accomplish this task.

**`/home/bob/terraform/main.tf`** 

```HCL
resource "aws_iam_role" "role" {
  name = "iamrole_kareem"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  })

  tags = {
    Name        = "iamrole_kareem"
  }
}
```

## Remove the resource from state so Terraform won't track it

```sh
terraform state rm aws_iam_role.role
```

## Optionally, delete it manually from AWS

```sh
aws iam delete-role --role-name iamrole_kareem
```
