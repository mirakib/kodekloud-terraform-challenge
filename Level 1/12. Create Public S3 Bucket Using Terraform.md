# Create Public S3 Bucket Using Terraform

As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several S3 buckets on AWS. They plan to utilize both private and public S3 buckets to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

1. Create a `public` **S3 bucket** named `xfusion-s3-16599` using Terraform.

2. **Ensure the bucket is accessible publicly once created** by setting the proper ACL.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different `.tf` file) to accomplish this task.


**`/home/bob/terraform/main.tf`** 

```HCL
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xfusion_bucket" {
  bucket = "xfusion-s3-16599"

  tags = {
    Name        = "xfusion-s3-16599"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "xfusion_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}
```

## How to apply

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
