# Delete IAM Group Using Terraform

Delete an IAM group named `iamgroup_mariyam` using terraform. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different `.tf` file) to accomplish this task.

**`/home/bob/terraform/main.tf`** 

```HCL
resource "aws_iam_group" "this" {
  name = "iamgroup_mariyam"
}
```

## Use targeted destroy so the code stays untouched:

```bash
terraform destroy -target=aws_iam_group.this
```
