# Delete VPC Using Terraform

Delete a VPC named `nautilus-vpc` present in `us-east-1` region using `Terraform`. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different `.tf` file) to accomplish this task.

**`/home/bob/terraform/main.tf`** 

```HCL
resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Name        = "nautilus-vpc"
  }
}
```

## Destroy only the `nautilus-vpc`

```bash
terraform destroy -target=aws_vpc.this
```
